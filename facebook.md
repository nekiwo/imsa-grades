# good afternoon 😏

In collaboration with the Office Of Institutional Research, we're excited to introduce **IMSA Grades**, the all-in-one grade viewer tool put together by some members of the IMPACT team. Here, **you can view information about any class, as well as some demographic breakdowns**. You should really check it out!

imsagrades.com

🐬 **What's the purpose?** To have an open repository of grade information for better visiblity and accessiblity of vital information.

💐 **What's on it?** _All grade data from the past 9 years_, sorted and compiled to be as easy to understand as possible. Check out 

🦖 **Why's this useful?** With distance learning 😔, we lose a lot of valuable information we pick up from our peers. This also serves as a useful tool for anybody to see what students need help on.

see it at **https://imsagrades.com**! review your new classes ‼️
