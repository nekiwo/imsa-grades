# **good afternoon** 😏

With school coming in the next couple of days, we're really excited to introduce IMSA Grades, the all-in-one grade viewer tool put together by some members of the IMPACT team. Here, you can view information about any class, as well as some demographic breakdowns. Look at the site!

imsagrades.com

🐬 What's the purpose? To have an open repository of grade information for better visibility and accessibility of important information.
💐 What's on it? All grade data from the past 9 years, sorted and compiled to be as easy to understand as possible.
🦖 Why's this useful? With distance learning 😔, we lose a lot of valuable information we pick up from our peers. This also serves as a useful tool for anybody to see what students need help on.
see it at https://imsagrades.com/! enjoy

Note: this is an unofficial website.
