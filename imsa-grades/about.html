                <i>This site was made for students, parents, teachers and all other community members to have clean and
                    consistent access to grades at the Illinois Mathematics and Sciecne Academy. Data was aquired
                    through a 2017 FOIA Request, by a '18 student. Data from 2018-2020 is currently being gathered.</i>
